Last weekend, my classmates and I went camping.

上个周末我和同学去露营。

We found a grassy spot beside a river.

We put up our tents and made a campfire.

Then, we fished at the river.

We had only one fishing rod, so we took turns.

After a while, we caught a big trout.

Finally, we sat around the fire, roasted the fish and sang songs.

最后, 我们围坐在营火旁，边烤鱼边唱歌。

Camping is really fun!
