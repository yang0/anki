Lesson 111 Confucius Confucius is respected by most Chinese as the greatest teacher of all time.

第111课　孔子 孔子被许许多多中国人尊为自古以来最伟大的老师。

Perhaps the most important word he taught us was " ren, " which means " benevolence." According to Confucius, benevolence means courtesy, loyalty and unselfishness.

或许他传授给我们的最重要的一个字就是“仁”，也就是仁慈的意思。根据孔子的说法，仁的意思就是礼貌，忠贞以及无私。

In fact, benevolence is the essence of his teachings. Every teacher should, therefore, follow in his footsteps and emphasize benevolence when teaching.

事实上，仁是他教义的精髓。因此，每个老师在教学时，应效法孔子并强调仁的道理。
